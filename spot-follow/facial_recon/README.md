## STATUS: 
Frontal face recognition is working and the program will attempt to vertically center the face within the cameras view. The program will attempt to look for a persons face profile if a frontal face is not found, but the distance it is able to accurately see a face seems to be shorter.

The Left Forward Facing camera is used to take pictures. There was an attempt to stitch the two forward facing cameras together, but it was unsuccessful. 

If it cannot find a face the program will look for a persons full, upper, and lower body. It does not yet do anything if it finds one.
